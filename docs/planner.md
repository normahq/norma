# Norma Planner (`norma plan`)

The `norma plan` command provides an interactive way to decompose high-level project goals (epics) into a structured Beads hierarchy of epics, features, and tasks.

## Interactive Planning

When you run `norma plan` (or `norma plan tui`), Norma starts an interactive TUI session powered by an LLM agent. The agent will:

1.  **Analyze** your goal.
2.  **Inspect** your current project state using available tools.
3.  **Ask** you clarification questions if the goal is vague or if it needs more context.
4.  **Propose** a decomposition into features and tasks.
5.  **Persist** the final plan to Beads.

## Line REPL Mode

If you prefer a plain terminal prompt (same interaction style as `acp-repl`), use:

```bash
norma plan repl
```

In REPL mode:
- Type prompts and press Enter to run a turn.
- Type `exit` or `quit` to close the REPL.
- ACP permission requests are shown interactively in terminal.

## Tools Available to the Planner

The planning agent has access to several tools to help it create accurate and actionable plans.

### `human`
Used by the agent to ask the user a question. The question appears in the TUI, and the agent waits for your response.

### `beads`
Enables the agent to interact with the Beads issue tracker directly.

*   **Operations:** `list`, `show`, `create`, `update`, `close`, `reopen`, `delete`, `ready`.
*   **Rules:**
    *   Enforce `--reason` for `close`, `reopen`, and `delete` operations.
    *   Always use `--sandbox` and `--json` for command-line operations.
    *   Preferred over running `bd` via `run_shell_command`.

### `run_shell_command`
Enables the agent to inspect the codebase and project structure.

*   **Allowed commands:** `ls`, `grep`, `cat`, `find`, `tree`, `git`, `go`, `echo`.
*   **Restrictions:**
    *   No pipes (`|`) or redirects (`>`, `>>`).
    *   No command chaining (`&&`, `||`, `;`, `&`).
    *   Commands are executed relative to the repository root.
    *   Timeout is 30 seconds per command.

## Using the Planner

To start a planning session:

```bash
norma plan
```

1.  Follow the prompts in the TUI.
2.  Answer any questions from the agent.
3.  Once the agent has enough information, it will generate the plan.
4.  The final plan will be displayed in the TUI.
5.  Press any key to exit the TUI.
6.  The plan will be persisted to your Beads backlog.
